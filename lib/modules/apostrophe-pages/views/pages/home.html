        State of Young Philly is an annual week long event series hosted every fall by Young Involved Philadelphia.

        Each year SOYP brings together over 50 partner organizations, and 1,000 young professionals, elected officials,
        and organizational leaders to examine the current state of young Philadelphia and generate change in our beloved city.

        Join us as we work to engage, connect, and represent the millennial generation, helping young Philadelphians become better equipped to affect change in Philadelphia.
