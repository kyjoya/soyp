    What is State of Young Philly?<br>
    State of Young Philly is an annual, week-long event series hosted every fall by Young Involved Philadelphia. Each year, SOYP brings together over 30 partner organizations, and 1,000 young professionals, elected officials, and organizational leaders to examine the current state of young Philadelphia and generate change in our beloved city.
    The event series, which kicks off on Friday, November 11 with YIP’s Civic Engagement Fair, continues until Saturday, Nov. 19 with a full calendar of events across the city. Join us as we work to engage, connect, and represent the millennial generation, helping young Philadelphians become better equipped to affect change in Philadelphia.
